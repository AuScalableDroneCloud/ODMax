    "# 3D point clouds and meshes from 360 degree videos with ODMax\n",
    "ODMax has the capability to collect a large set of sample photos for photogrammetry. Combined with the extremely powerful OpenDroneMap software, a streamlined pipeline of 360-degree videos into photogrammetry products can be established. Luckily, the WebODM software offers a web platform to OpenDroneMap with an API that can be approached from python. To use this example, you need to have a running WebODM server (can be a local one on your current device via `docker`.\n",
    "Also you need to provide an .env file, in the notebook folder, or manually add your server details to your system environment variables. Here you can supply the server details and your login credentials. Below we will of course first check if your credentials are indeed picked up.\n",
