Welcome to ODMax's documentation!
=================================

ODMax is a command-line and API utility to convert 360-degree videos from platforms such as GoPro, or Google Insta
series into 360 degree stills or Front, Right, Left, Back, Up and Down projected stills. A major use case for this
tool is development of 3D point clouds and meshes in software such as OpenDroneMap.
